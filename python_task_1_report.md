1. Sum of Two Numbers
Approach: Used the input() function to read two integers from the user and + operator to calculate the sum.

Concepts Used: Typecasting (int), basic arithmetic.

2. Odd or Even
Approach: Checked if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%). If the result is 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.

Concepts Used: Conditional statements, modulus operator.

3. Factorial Calculation
Approach: Used a for loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n. Could also use math.factorial, but implemented manually for practice.

Concepts Used: Loops, integer multiplication.

4. Fibonacci Sequence
Approach: Started with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0, 1), then used a loop to generate the rest by adding the last two numbers.

Concepts Used: Loops, list operations.

5. Reverse a String
Approach: Used Python slicing [::-1] to reverse the string in one line.

Concepts Used: String manipulation, slicing.

6. Palindrome Check
Approach: Compared the original string with its reversed version. If both are equal, it’s a palindrome.

Concepts Used: String comparison, slicing.

7. Leap Year Check
Approach: Implemented the leap year logic: A year divisible by 4 is a leap year, unless it’s also divisible by 100 (but not 400).

Concepts Used: Conditional logic, modulus operator.

8. Armstrong Number
Approach: Converted the number to a string to count digits, then summed each digit raised to that power.

Concepts Used: Loops, string conversion, exponentiation.

Custom Encryption-Decryption System
Approach: Used a simple Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption.

Each letter is shifted by a given key.

Special characters are left unchanged.

Encryption Function: Shifts letters forward.

Decryption Function: Shifts letters backward using the same logic.
